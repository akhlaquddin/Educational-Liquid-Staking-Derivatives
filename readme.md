# Educational Liquid Staking Derivatives (EduStake)

## Project Description
EduStake is an innovative liquid staking platform that combines decentralized finance (DeFi) with educational funding. The platform allows users to stake their ETH and receive EDU tokens as liquid staking derivatives, while the staked assets are used to fund and support educational initiatives. This creates a sustainable funding mechanism for education while providing stakers with liquid tokens they can use in the DeFi ecosystem.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and educational funding by creating a sustainable, transparent, and efficient mechanism for supporting educational initiatives. By implementing liquid staking derivatives, we enable supporters of education to contribute to meaningful projects while maintaining liquidity and earning rewards. This system creates a win-win situation where stakers can participate in DeFi activities while simultaneously supporting educational development.
